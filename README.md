# Intro

Ggis-bot was a small, personal summer project that escalated into something a little bigger. Originally designed to be used for a private Discord server among friends, Ggis sports some pretty useful (as well as some pretty *useless*) features that help keep us entertained to this day.

### The $%&# is a "Ggis"?

My Discord username is Sigg.

Ggis is Sigg backwards.

Yep, there you go.

### Features & Commands

- **StreamLink** : Pushes notifications when linked users go live on Twitch.tv
- **LFG** : "Looking for group" helps you find people to play a game with you
- **AutoReact** : Automatic emoji reactions or message replies when specified users get @mentioned or when specific phrases are said
- Programmable **chat filters**
- Fetch random posts from any of Reddit's subreddits
- Open up fortune cookies, Random Jaden Smith Tweets, Key & Peele videos, and other useless & silly commands
- ... and more

(use the `help` command to get a list of commands)
