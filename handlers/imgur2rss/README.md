This module is an edited version of https://www.npmjs.com/package/imgur2rss (https://github.com/statico/imgur2rss) by statico

His module limited the callback to only include the first 10 images of an Imgur album. It was edited to include ALL images from an Imgur album and externalized here so that `npm install` would not revert to older versions of the module.
